# Virtual_devices
These objects act as stand in sensors for our top level motion api to talk to.
From there, these objects used the software bus to talk to the *actual hardware.

## Virtual_Motor
Acts a proxy object for the *actual motor hardware. The only thing it can do is:
Set direction
Start
Stop

## Virtual_sensor
Acts a proxy object for the *actual sensor hardware. The only thing it can do is:
Check triggered

*The 'actual hardware' is a mock up of the hardware, which decisions are being informed
by motion simulator, see Hardware, and Simulation.MotionSimulation.
