# Elevator Project
Ding-dong you have reached the: CS460 Elevator Project

# RULES
You should only work off your team's branch. You can branch off your team's branch by following the instructions here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/git-create-a-branch-from-another-branch/.

In order to push to `main`, you will need two reviews. The managers should provide these reviews. Alex Knigge has to be one of the reviewers for the final merge to be made. 

If you have any questions, reach out to Alex at aknigge1@unm.edu or your manager.
